A long-awaited and nice-to-have feature has just been released: **Button control with icon**.  

Previously, we had to:  
- Use a container to group an icon control and a text control.  
- Or even use a hidden button control.  
- Manually manage where to put the expression for the **OnSelect()** event.  

Now, all of this is available with a **single button control**! ðŸŽ‰

## New Properties

- **Icon**: choose an icon  
- **Layout**: options include *Icon before text*, *Icon after text*, *Icon only*, *Text only*  
- **Icon style**: *Filled* or *Outline*
