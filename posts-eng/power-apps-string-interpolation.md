String interpolation is a technique to evaluate a string literal containing placeholders. In C#, we use `$"string"` for interpolation, and in Python, we use `f"string"`. In Power Fx, string interpolation helps us place the right data into the right place without splitting a main string. Without it, we had to split the main string into many small pieces to insert the data between words.

You can use string interpolation wherever Power Fx exists, including Power Apps, Dataverse, and Copilot Studio.

Some benefits:

* **Readability and Clarity**: String interpolation makes code easier to read and understand by clearly showing where the data is inserted into strings. This also improves code maintainability and makes debugging easier.
* **Reduced Errors**: By directly embedding expressions within string literals, string interpolation reduces the risk of errors that can occur with concatenation, such as missing spaces or incorrect ordering of variables.
* **Performance**: With this technique, you donâ€™t have to create multiple strings and concatenate them, thus reducing overhead costs and improving performance, especially when working with long strings.

Here is the normal way:

And with string interpolation:

To escape sequences in an interpolated string, use double curly braces:
