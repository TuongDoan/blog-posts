**Power Apps Authoring Version** refers to the version of Power Apps Studio, the tool you use to develop your apps. Microsoft releases new authoring versions quite often to deliver new features, improvements, and bug fixes. By default, Microsoft will load the most stable version with high compatibility for you.

## Why New Authoring Versions Matter

A newer authoring version than the default usually comes with:  
- New features, enhancements, or new controls that improve your development experience.  
- Fixes for known issues, which can help resolve bugs you might encounter.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The recommended version loaded by default is always the most stable and highly compatible one. Higher authoring versions may introduce compatibility issues with older components or integrated services.

## Downgrading to a Lower Version

If the current version gives you temporary compatibility issues or bugs, you can downgrade to the lower authoring version you used before.

## How to Change the Power Apps Authoring Version

1. From **Power Apps Studio**, choose **Settings**.  
2. In the **Support** tab, you can see your current authoring version. Click **Edit** to open the *Change authoring version* popup.  
3. Select an authoring version, then hit **Reload + apply version** to apply the new authoring version to the studio.

## Important Notes

- When you click **Reload + apply version**, it only applies to the **current session**. When you open the studio again in another session, you must switch again.  
- The release schedule varies depending on your environment location.
