The old real-time collaboration method allowed multiple makers/developers to access the app, but only **one person could edit at a time**.  

Now, with the new **Co-Authoring** feature, a team can work on a single canvas app **simultaneously**. This update will:  
- Boost productivity  
- Accelerate development speed  
- Improve overall project efficiency

## My Experience

- Tested the new Co-Authoring version and was impressed with the **synchronization speed** between devices. Itâ€™s very fast!  
- I could see other app makers working on the same app with me.  
- Others can see exactly which part of the app you are working on. For example: when I worked on the side section of the app, my avatar appeared on that screen, in that container.
