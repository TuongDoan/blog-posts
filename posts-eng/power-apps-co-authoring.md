The old real-time collaboration method allowed multiple makers/developers to access the app, but only one person could edit at a time. Now, with the new **Co-Authoring** feature, we can have a team work on a single canvas app simultaneously. This update will boost productivity, accelerate development speed, and, more importantly, improve the overall efficiency of the whole project.

I tested this new Co-Authoring version for a while and am very impressed with the speed of synchronizing between devices. **It’s fast!**

You can see other app makers working on the same app with you.

Others can see exactly which part of the app you are working on. In the first image, I am working on the side section of the app, and my avatar shows up exactly on that screen, in that container!
