title: 'Http button PCF: Make HTTP request locally'
description: >-
  A Power Apps custom component (PCF) that allows you to send HTTP requests from your app locally
date: '2025-08-02'
tag: Power Apps,PCF

This is a simple button that makes **HTTP calls directly from the browser** — no Custom Connector and not directly integrated with **Premium Power Automate**.

I originally built this for a bank where the core layer and core integration layer only allowed internal network access. To sync master data from their internal platform, this **PCF** was essential, as external access (Microsoft’s cloud) was blocked.

There is another version that supports **OAuth2** and can strip malicious payloads later, but I think this version is sufficient for most community use cases.

# ⚠️ Important Notice on Security and DLP

This component executes HTTP requests directly in the user’s browser, which means it does not comply with Power Platform Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies.

➡️ Please use this component at your own risk, especially in environments with strict governance, security, or compliance requirements.

I recommend using it only with trusted APIs and avoiding sensitive or confidential data in ungoverned environments.
